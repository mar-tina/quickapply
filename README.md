## The goal 
To build an extension that allows users to send an email from the current page they are on

- [ ] Allowing users to take screenshots
- [ ] Grab links
- [ ] Grab email accounts off the page
- [ ] Create drafts to send later [WIP]

## Future prospects
- Autocomplete for sites that require you to input data step by step

## Motivation
Currently looking for work. Going back and forth form job sites and gmail is a bit tedious when 
you are required to send an email to a company email 

### Running the App
- Clone the app into your local machine.
- Navigate to chrome://extensions.
- Activate developer mode.
- Click on Load unpacked.
- Add the complete extensions folder in the root dir.
